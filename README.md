# Numemory

**A variant of the popular Memory game in which you have to flip all cards in the correct order**

## The game

- Suitable for any number of players.
- There are 10 cards consecutively numbered from 1 to 10 on their front sides.
- At the beginning of the game all cards are shuffled, then placed upside down on the table.
- The goal is to flip over all cards in ascending order in one go without any mistakes.

## Rules

1. Players take turns by flipping over one card at a time.
2. If it's a card that's in order the player can continue with step 1.
3. If not, all revealed cards are flipped upside down and the next player takes a turn.
4. A player wins if he manages to flip over all cards in the correct order. The game restarts.

## Ideas

### Variants

- More cards increase difficulty.
- Less cards decrease difficulty.
- Show cards' front sides for a limited time at the beginning of the game to make it easier.
- Cards must be flipped over in reverse order.
- After wrong turn, cards stay visible until table is clicked/touched.

### Thematic decks

In the following variants the players first have to figure out which cards are lowest and highest ;-)

- Cards are not numbered consecutively but following a mathematical sequence , e.g. Fibonacci numbers, prime numbers … (see [OEIS](https://oeis.org/) for inspiration).
- Cards are numbered with historical years accompanied by pictures of famous people that were born in this year, or of events that happened in this year.
- Expert mode: Cards show _only_ the pictures of historical figures.
